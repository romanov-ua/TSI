                    <p>iDubbbz has been credited for making several videos and cameos that became Internet memes.

                        Content Cop
                        iDubbbz's Content Cop series highlights other YouTube channels, critiquing their content as well as their owner's behavior on social media. From December 2015 to October 2017, iDubbbz released Content Cop episodes on a wide variety of YouTube personalities, including LeafyIsHere, Tana Mongeau, and RiceGum.
                        
                        In May 2016, iDubbbz released a Content Cop video on Daniel Keem, better known as Keemstar, and his channel DramaAlert. According to The Daily Beast, iDubbbz accused Keemstar of using DramaAlert to "promote his friends and punish his enemies". In response, Keem called the Content Cop video "entertaining" and denied wanting to attack other YouTubers, saying he has "no problem booking guests or landing exclusive interviews".
                        
                        In October 2017, iDubbbz uploaded a video titled "Content Cop – Jake Paul", which has over 50 million views as of May 2021. However, the 31-minute video was not about the YouTube personality Jake Paul, instead it was about RiceGum. in the video, iDubbbz analyzes and critiques RiceGum in a format inspired by the seven deadly sins. Released along with the Content Cop episode, iDubbbz released a music video for a diss track of RiceGum titled "Asian Jake Paul", which featured Boyinaband. The song has over 85 million views as of August 2021. The song peaked at number 24 on the R&B/Hip-hop Digital Song Sales chart. RiceGum responded with several videos, including "Frick Da Police", a response diss track, and a 22-minute video response.
                         iDubbbz responded with a follow-up video titled "Content Deputy – AJP" rebutting RiceGum's responses, featuring a comedic cameo by rapper Post Malone, and stating that this would be his final response to the situation.
                        
                        In late 2019, three years after Ian's Content Cop episode on LeafyIsHere, YouTube removed the video as a consequence of the website's updated policies on harassment and bullying.
