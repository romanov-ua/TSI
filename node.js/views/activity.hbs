Released along with the Content Cop episode, iDubbbz released a music video for a diss track of RiceGum titled "Asian Jake Paul", which featured Boyinaband.

RiceGum responded with several videos, including "Frick Da Police", a response diss track, and a 22-minute video response.
                         iDubbbz responded with a follow-up video titled "Content Deputy – AJP" rebutting RiceGum's responses, featuring a comedic cameo by rapper Post Malone, and stating that this would be his final response to the situation.
                        
                        In late 2019, three years after Ian's Content Cop episode on LeafyIsHere, YouTube removed the video as a consequence of the website's updated policies on harassment and bullying.
